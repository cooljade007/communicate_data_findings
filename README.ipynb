    "# OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Udacity's fifth project under Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. This project focused on performing an exploratory data analysis using Python (Matplotlib and Seaborn) and then creating a presentation with explanatory plots that communicate our findings . (Completed on February 24, 2019) \n",

    "# ABOUT THE DATASET\n",
    "\n",
    "PISA is a unique global survey that examines how well prepared 15 year old students are for life after they have completed school. Approximately half a million students and 65 economies participated in this assessment that deals with reading, math, and science literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full 2012 PISA dataset can be found [here.](pisa2012.csv/pisa2012.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PISA data dictionary, which gives a brief explaination of each feature, can be found [here.](pisadict2012.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "The original PISA 2012 dataset contained information from 485,490 students and 646 features. After our data cleaning process, we condensed the number of features to 10: country, gender, overall math score, motivation score, anxiety score, interest score, work ethic score, behavior score, and parent's attitude towards math score. All features under attitude (with the exception of anxiety) have a scale of 4 points, marking highest positive attitude, to 1 point, marking a negative attitude. Anxiety works conversly, where 1 points shows a student to be less anxious (positive attitude) and 4 points being really anxious towards math (negative attitude).\n",

    "In this investigation, I wanted to take a closer a look at what attitudes of both the students and parents that contributed to overall PISA score's gender gap. The main focus was gender, different kinds of attitudes of students towards math (motivation, anxiety, interest, work ethic, behavior) as well as the the student's perception on how their parent's view math.

    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exploration, I found that the top performing students (based on their overall math scores) were majority males. Surprisingly, when I explored further and took the top 75th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile of students, I noticed that this proportion of male student continued to increase. When I ploted the results on a line plot, we can see clearly that as the top percentile of students increased, so does the gender gap. Initially, the female proportion was higher (due to the fact that there was a slightly more female students taking the survey as compared to the male students). But by the time we arrived to the top (approximately) 20th percentile, the amount of female students was equal to the amount of male students. Throughout the increase of top percentiles, we see that the proportion of male students strictly increases as well. The further we get along the top percentile of students, the gender gap's increase accelerates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see a pattern among the student and parent's attitude towards math for our top performing students. As the top pecentile of students increases, the male students' average scores for motivation, behavior, perception of parent's attitude towards math, interest, and self perception always remained higher than the female students' average scores under these categories. All of these categories were positive attitudes. Contrary, the female student's average score under anxiety always remained higher that the male students average score as the top percentile of students increased. The only positive attitude that continued to remain higher than the male counterpart was work ethic."
